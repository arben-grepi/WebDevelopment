# TypeScript Objects

TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript, enhances how you work with objects by introducing type annotations and interfaces. This adds a layer of type safety and better tooling support, which makes your code more robust and maintainable.

## 1. Basic Object Syntax

### JavaScript

In JavaScript, objects are created without type annotations:

```javascript
const person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30
};

TypeScript
In TypeScript, you can add type annotations to object properties:

const person: { name: string; age: number } = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30
};


2. Interfaces
TypeScript provides interfaces to define the shape of an object, promoting reusability and readability:

interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

const person: Person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30
};

3. Optional Properties
TypeScript allows properties to be optional by using the ? symbol:

interface Person {
    name: string;
    age?: number; // age is optional
}

const person: Person = {
    name: 'John'
};

4. Readonly Properties
Properties can be marked as readonly, ensuring they cannot be modified after the object is created:

interface Person {
    readonly name: string;
    age: number;
}

const person: Person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30
};

// This will cause an error
// person.name = 'Jane';


5. Index Signatures
Index signatures allow you to define properties with dynamic keys:

interface StringArray {
    [index: number]: string;
}

const myArray: StringArray = ['Bob', 'Alice'];

interface Dictionary {
    [key: string]: string;
}

const myDictionary: Dictionary = {
    key1: 'value1',
    key2: 'value2'
};


6. Extending Interfaces
Interfaces can be extended to create more complex types:

interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

interface Employee extends Person {
    employeeId: number;
}

const employee: Employee = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30,
    employeeId: 1234
};


7. Intersection Types
TypeScript also supports intersection types to combine multiple types into one:

interface Person {
    name: string;
}

interface Employee {
    employeeId: number;
}

const employee: Person & Employee = {
    name: 'John',
    employeeId: 1234
};


8. Type Aliases
Type aliases can also be used to define object types, offering a similar capability to interfaces:

type Person = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
};

const person: Person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30
};


9. Function Properties
Objects can include properties that are functions, with type annotations for their parameters and return types:

interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    greet: () => void;
}

const person: Person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30,
    greet: () => {
        console.log('Hello');
    }
};


qwConclusion

TypeScript enhances JavaScript objects by introducing type annotations, interfaces, and other advanced features like optional and readonly properties, index signatures, and more. These additions improve code quality and maintainability by providing static type checking and better documentation through type definitions.
