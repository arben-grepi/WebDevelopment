Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It's designed for building scalable and efficient network applications:

Open-source and cross-platform: Freely available and runs on various operating systems like Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.
JavaScript runtime environment: Executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, expanding its application beyond front-end development.
Event-driven and non-blocking: Handles multiple requests efficiently without blocking the main thread, making it suitable for real-time applications.
Here's a breakdown of some key characteristics:

Benefits:

Single language: Developers can use JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development, reducing context switching and simplifying development processes.
Scalability: Node.js excels at handling high-concurrency and real-time applications due to its non-blocking architecture.
Large community and ecosystem: Boasts a vast community and extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, providing solutions for various development needs.
Use Cases:

Web servers and APIs: Popular for building back-end services and APIs that power web applications.
Real-time applications: Ideal for building chat applications, real-time dashboards, and other applications requiring frequent data updates.
Microservices architecture: Well-suited for building microservices, which are small, independent services that communicate with each other to form larger applications.
Comparison to Traditional JavaScript:

Traditional JavaScript: Primarily runs in web browsers to create interactive web pages.
Node.js: Executes JavaScript code outside the browser, enabling server-side scripting and building network applications.
In summary, Node.js empowers developers to leverage their JavaScript expertise for building efficient and scalable back-end applications, expanding the potential of JavaScript beyond the traditional web browser environment.

Unlike .Net, Node.js is asynchrones by default. This makes Node ideal for web application that
require a lot of disk or network acceess. We dont need to have a lot of hardware inorder to serve many clients.
