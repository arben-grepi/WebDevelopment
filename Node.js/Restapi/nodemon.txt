npm i -g nodemon

instead of running application using node, we can using nodemon

Nodemon is a helpful tool for developers who work with Node.js applications. 
It's essentially a command-line program that watches for changes in your project's files.
  When it detects a change, it automatically restarts your Node.js application, 
  saving you the time and hassle of manually stopping and restarting the server yourself.
   This can significantly speed up your development workflow, especially when you're 
   making frequent code edits and testing them.
