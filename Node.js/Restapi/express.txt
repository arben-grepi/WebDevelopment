Express.js, often shortened to Express, is a popular web application framework built on top of Node.js. It's essentially a tool that simplifies building web applications and 
APIs using JavaScript.

Here are some key points about Express:

- **Focus on Simplicity and Flexibility:** Express is known for its minimalist approach, providing a core set of features without being overly restrictive. 
This allows developers to have more control over their application architecture.
- **Routing:** A core functionality of Express is routing. It lets you define how your application responds to different HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
 based on the URL path. This way, you can create specific handlers for different functionalities of your web application.
- **Middleware:** Middleware functions are a powerful concept in Express. They act as intercepts for incoming HTTP requests, allowing you to perform common 
tasks like logging, authentication, or data parsing before reaching the final route handler.
- **API Development:** Express is excellent for building RESTful APIs, a standard for creating web services with a defined set of operations. 
It provides features for handling data formats like JSON and sending appropriate HTTP status codes.
- **Open Source and Community-Driven:** Express is free and open-source software, with a large and active community. This translates to extensive documentation,
tutorials, and a wide range of third-party libraries and frameworks built on top of Express, further extending its functionalities.
